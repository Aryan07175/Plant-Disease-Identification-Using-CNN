# 🌱 Plant Disease Identification Using CNN

An end-to-end **Plant Disease Detection System** built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to accurately identify plant diseases from leaf images. This project leverages deep learning to help farmers, researchers, and agri-tech enthusiasts detect diseases at an early stage and take preventive action.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Plant diseases significantly affect agricultural productivity. Manual detection is time-consuming and requires expertise.  
This project automates the process by using **Computer Vision + Deep Learning**, enabling fast and accurate disease classification from images of plant leaves.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Input an image of a plant leaf  
2. Image is preprocessed (resizing, normalization, augmentation)  
3. CNN extracts important visual features  
4. Model predicts the disease category  
5. Output is displayed with high accuracy
